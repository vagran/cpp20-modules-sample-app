Sample application for [ADK gradle plugin](https://github.com/vagran/adk-cpp-gradle-plugin) and
[ADK library](https://github.com/vagran/adk-cpp) demonstrating use of C++20 modules.

It is currently can be built but still no luck with finding fully functional IDE which can properly
work with C++20 modules. There are various problems with major IDEs in different configurations, 
several ones are reported. The most close is VSCode with clangd but clangd currently crashes when
trying to index the files.

Before building create `gradle.properties` file in `src` directory with the following content:
```
adkCxx=/path/to/bin/clang++
```

Update Git submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build the application:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

Compilation database can be generated by:
```bash
./gradlew generateCompileDb
```

Build artifacts can be found in `src/build/debug`.

When running the resulted executable you probably will need to add Clang libraries to the search
path:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/clang-13/lib
```

Only most recent Clang versions are supported (tested with 13.0.0, known to crash the compiler with 
12). There are still bugs in the Clang related to proper implementation of C++20 modules 
(e.g. [lambda functions showstopper](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51607)).
